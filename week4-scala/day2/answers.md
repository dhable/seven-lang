_Q: Find what makes a closure different from a code block._

The key difference between a closure and a code block relates to how many open terms (variables) exist in the expression. A closure by definition has no open terms (everything's closed). Whether a code block can be passed around, defined anomonously, or bind to lexically scoped variables doesn't matter.
