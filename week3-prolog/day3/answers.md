_Q: Prolog has some input/output features as well. Find print predicates that print out variables._

This is the higher level predicates that can be used to perform I/O operations on an entire stream.

This appears to be the predicates that implement more of the single character at a time operations.

And if you happen to be on a DEC machine, then there's a special section for you.
