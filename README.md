Dan's Seven Languages in Seven Weeks Solutions
==============================================

This github repository contains all of my self study solutions that I worked through while reading "Seven Languages in Seven Weeks" by Bruce A. Tate (ISBN: 9781934356593). Solutions are broken down by week/language and then by day(section) in the book. Self study problems that only required written answers are in the answers.md file for the day. I've gone back and added comments to much of the code to explain why the code works or what my thought process was.

I'm still not done (working on Haskell) so changes will occur.


Reporting Bugs
--------------
From a learning perspective, I would apperciate feedback from other visitors if something seems wrong or better ways exist of solving these problems. Bruce didn't necessarly publish his solutions but many other readers have done the same as me and published their solutions for comparison. This is github so leave a comment on the offending line or open an issue.
